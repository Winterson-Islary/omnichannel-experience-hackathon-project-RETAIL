## Hackathon Problem Statement: Challenge V: Retail – Fixing fragmented shopping experience

### The Problem We're Solving

- Today's retail customers face a "fragmented experience" as they move between online browsing, mobile app shopping, and in-store interactions. This disconnect creates a jarring, impersonal journey, leading directly to the core business problem: "missed up-sell and cross-sell opportunities".

### Why We Chose This Problem

- High Business Impact: This challenge directly targets the most critical metrics for retail growth: "increasing Average Order Value (AOV) and conversion rates".   

- High Technical Value: It allows us to solve a sophisticated architectural problem. The goal is to create a "unified, human-like conversational journey", which requires us to master "context switching and session continuity".
